- no worries man, im using this web a lot, the % remaining thing + the interface is so good and clean, and the linking to every quest and pathing its just awesome, you should share this web more, its amazing
- maybe link it throught the culstist circle calculator, at first I went to that page to look for new links when the old one wasnt working and I couldnt find a link on there so I msaged u here
- only thing I would change is the hideout tab, make icons bigger or just sort them by icons and needs
- also maybe on the collector item taks, when u mark one item it goes to the end of the list so all not marked items are always first and easy to look
- everything else its just so well made i love it, can keep progress on everything pretty easy and good looking
- and the map tab is also very nice
